# au-client-skeleton
An Aurelia Client skeleton application with flair.

This is a base Aurelia client application with the enhanement that the client will perform a web service API call to a web server. This demonstrates the linkage that can exist between an Aurelia client application and a web server providing web service functionality.

This client was used in the testing of the Aurelia Client Server Skeleton application found [here](https://github.com/jet3723/au-client-server-skeleton.git). 

## Client Enhancements
These are all the differences between an Aurelia client generated by **au new** and this client.

- Added the packages **aurelia-fetch-client** and **whatwg-fetch**.
  * npm install aurelia-fetch-client
  * npm install whatwg-fetch
  * Edited **aurelia_project/aurelia.json** to add the new packages to the bundler.
- Added the **doapi()** and **doclear()** functions to the base class **App.js**.
- Added extra HTML to the base view **App.html**.
