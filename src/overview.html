  <h1> Application Runner Overview </h1>
  <p>The Application Runner is another step in creating a rich
    Aurelia Client Server application. The Application Runner adds
    a tutorial selector in a left sidebar navigation pane. A content
    pane is used to display the selected tutorial application. The
    Application Runner demonstrates the ability of Aurelia to 
    manage multiple single page applications.</p>

    <p>The Client Server Skeleton application was developed as a stand-alone 
      single page application that demonstrated an Aurelia Client integrated 
      with a Node JS server. The Application Runner's first tutorial is the 
      Application Runner Overview (what you are reading now). The second
      tutorial is the Client Server Skeleton application. What you will notice
      is that beyond a little code re-factoring to make the Client Server application
      fit in the Application Runner, the Client Server application has really not
      been modified.</p>
